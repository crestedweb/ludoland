🚀 Key Features
⚡ Single-File Architecture: The entire game engine, 3D assets, UI, and logic are contained within one single HTML file. No external assets, builds, or frameworks required.
🌍 Multi-Language Support: Full localization for:
🇬🇧 English
🇳🇬 Pidgin
🇳🇬 Hausa
🇳🇬 Yoruba
🇳🇬 Igbo
🎲 Physics-Based Dice: A 3D dice that tumbles, spins, and lands using real-time animation logic.
🤖 Intelligent AI: Play against up to 3 Computer opponents with adjustable difficulty (Easy/Hard).
🎨 Modern UI: Features a "Glassmorphism" design with dynamic lighting, smooth transitions, and responsive layouts for Mobile and Desktop.
🔊 Audio Engine: Sound effects generated purely via JavaScript (Web Audio API)—no MP3 files used!

This project was built using a structured Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):
Phase 1: Environment Setup & Grid Initialization.
Phase 2: Procedural Board Texture Generation (Canvas API).
Phase 3: Mathematical Logic & Pathfinding Algorithms.
Phase 4: 3D Asset Creation (Tokens & Dice).
Phase 5: Gameplay Loop Implementation (Turns, Movement, Captures).
Phase 6: UI Overhaul (Glassmorphism), Audio, and Mobile Optimization.
